<p>The Parser takes typed user input and tries to map it to objects in the 
game world. The <a href="Parser.html">Parser</a> converts the input to a form
suitable for <a href="../command/package-summary.html">command handling</a>.</p>

<p>The Parser may be different for each language, e.g. English or German.
(Actually, the grammar is different, e.g. for languages that place adjectives 
in front of or behind the corresponding noun, compare English &quot;red wine&quot;
and Spanish &quot;vino tinto&quot; -- and German avoids this by having a noun 
for it (&quot;Rotwein&quot;).)</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>For each input given to <a href="Parser.html#parse(java.lang.String)">parse</a>, 
the Parser checks whether it starts with a known preposition or separator, or
does fit anything in the room. If not, it's considered a verb. If it isn't 
a verb, the last verb from the history is used.</p>

<p>The objects in the room are called <a href="Description.html">Description</a>s,
since they hold the description on which the Parser works.
You <em>do</em> want to use the <a href="DefaultDescription.html">DefaultDescription</a>
only.</p>

<p>The parser asks the room for the object that fits the given input best. 
The room (as well as the inventory) is, from the Parser's point of view, 
just a collection of parseable <a href="Description.html">Description</a>s, 
i.e. a <a href="BunchOfItems.html">BunchOfItems</a>. 
The <a href="DefaultBunchOfItems.html">DefaultBunchOfItems</a>
asks all its <a href="Description.html">Description</a> and returns the 
<a href="BestMatch.html">best matching one</a>. 
If the input is ambiguous, the BunchOfItems returns a collection of the 
best-fitting items. The Parser then throws an 
<a href="AmbiguousInputException.html">AmbiguousInputException</a>.</p>

<p>Example: in the room are a green box and a red box. The input &quot;look 
box&quot; is ambiguous and the parser rejects it.</p>

<p>Each <a href="Description.html">Description</a> can compute its likeliness 
that some given input refers to it.</p>

<p>Example: The green box may react to articles &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot;
with a weak score, because just an article can be anything in the BunchOfItems.
It can return a higher score for adjectives like &quot;green&quot;, &quot;light
green&quot; and &quot;lime&quot;. Finally it can return a high score for nouns 
like &quot;box&quot; or &quot;crate&quot;. &quot;Look red box&quot; will score 
zero, because the adjective &quot;red&quot; does not match.</p>

<p>After restoring or restarting the game, the restore / restart code should 
call the Parser's <a href="Parser.html#discardInput()">discardInput</a> method
to remove any unparsed input the parser may still have. It would be quite 
confusing to enter a command like &quot;open box and look inside&quot;, then  
die on opening the box (maybe it was trapped?) and then restore and have the 
parser try to make something of the &quot;look inside&quot;.</p>


<h3>Capabilities</h3>
<p>Currently, the Parser does the following (reasonable vocabulary assumed):
<ul>
	<li>Recognizes simple commands like &quot;look&quot;, &quot;take box&quot;, 
	&quot;talk to man&quot;</li>
	<li>Complains about and removes duplicate words from the input</li>
	<li>Rejects unknown words or word combinations</li>
	<li>Handles more than one command in one input: &quot;look man and talk to 
	him&quot; and also &quot;open box and look inside&quot; or &quot;look box 
	and  man&quot; or &quot;look drum and base tape&quot; (note the different 
	use of &quot;and&quot;)</li>
	<li>Recognizes simple pronoun and substitutes the last noun, like in 
	&quot;look man&quot; and then &quot;talk to him&quot;, which is the same as 
	typing &quot;look man and talk man&quot; or like &quot;look tree and climb 
	up&quot; which is the same as &quot;look tree and climb up tree&quot;</li>
	<li>Distinguishes between similar objects in a room: if there is a red and 
	a blue box and you just type &quot;look box&quot; it will ask you something 
	like &quot;Ambiguous input, do you mean the red box or the blue box?&quot;</li>
	<li>Logs unknown words during playtesting for improving the vocabulary</li>
    <li>Flexible error recovery: assume a room with a red and a green box. The
    player types &quot;put gem in box&quot;. The parser rejects this and asks
    &quot;Do you mean the red box or the green box?&quot; You can then just
    type &quot;red box&quot; and the Parser will know the command is supposed
    to be &quot;put gem in red box&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<p>In the <a href="GermanParser.html">GermanParser</a> there are also some 
additional simplifications for German, like transforming umlauts (&auml; becomes 
ae).</p>


<h3>To do</h3>
<p>Things to do (ordered more or less by importance):<ul>
	<li>Allow multi-word separators like &quot;after that&quot;; currently only 
	one-word separators (&quot;and&quot;, &quot;then&quot;) are allowed.</li>
</ul></p>	

<h3>To think about (in no particular order)</h3>
<p><ul>
	<li>Reject two prepositions? &quot;take lid off under vent&quot;</li>
	<li>Multi word prepositions: &quot;in front of&quot;</li>
	<li>Remove certain special character like quotes, commas, etc.?</li>
	<li>Translate numbers, e.g. &quot;one&quot; -&gt; 1?</li>
	<li>Allow discarding special words in the beginning or end of the input, to
	accept commands like &quot;now open box&quot; or &quot;Roger, open the
	box&quot;?</li>
	<li>Simplify parsed input by sorting nouns<ul>
		<li>alphabetically: &quot;rub berries on body&quot; and &quot;rub body 
		berries&quot; would both be &quot;RUB BERRIES BODY&quot; -- is this 
		always the same or does this distort the meaning?</li>
		<li>by meaning: &quot;give man gem&quot; and &quot;give gem to man&quot;
		can be sorted to do &lt;what&gt; to / with &lt;whom&gt; -- can that 
		distort the meaning?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Handle &quot;all&quot;? But how does the parser know that &quot;all&quot;
	does not include walls, floor, and so on? Should each noun have an all
	attribute? Handle &quot;all but the foo&quot; (&quot;everything except 
	for&quot;)?</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Not to do (and why not)</h3>
<p><ul>
	<li>Add a dialog menu system to the parser. This has nothing to do with 
	parsing. It should get its own class or package.</li>
	<li>Handle typed dialogs, like the user typing &quot;yes&quot; as a response 
	to a question the game asked. This should be handled in a the Command 
	Handling code (define &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; 
	and whatever more you need as commands (or verbs) and react on those).</li>
</ul></p>
