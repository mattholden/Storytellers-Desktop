The <code>org.gemini.rules.dXX</code> package defines the rule set common to all
dXX system games. As the dXX core mechanics are fairly universal, a very substantial
chunk of the functionality for the games is provided here. 

In most cases, the user wishing to define a new dXX-derived game will wish to derive
subclasses from the data object classes presented here, adding new rules and actions
as appropriate. Only the smallest of classes in this package (for example, <code>DxxAction</code>,
<code>DxxAbilityScore</code>, <code>DxxSize</code> and <code>DxxSavingThrow</code>, are appropriate to be
used directly in a derivative game.
