The <code>org.gemini.tests</code> package contains all of the JUnit and acceptance
tests for the core Gemini System API. Its internal structure mirrors that of the 
<code>org.gemini</code> package. 

This package is of minimal importance to users of the API, and is an optional download.
It is of interest primarily to developers wishing to modify the core contents of the
Gemini System API. No change to the Subversion repository for Gemini is permitted unless
the build has successfully passed 100% of the tests in this package and its subpackages.
