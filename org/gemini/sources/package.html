The <code>org.gemini.sources</code> package defines the classes needed to interact
with source material in the Gemini System API. "Source Material" is defined here as
any book, magazine, publication, or Web site which presents data (defined here as 
races, classes, prestige classes, spells, skills, psionic powers, feats, inventory 
items, NPCs, campaign settings, rule sets, and all other rule-based objects in the Gemini
System). 

These sources are kept in order to ensure compliance with the licensing and attribution
requirements of most gaming systems, and to properly give credit where it is due.

Data objects which are derived from a source should implement the <code>ObjectFromSource</code>
interface, and contain a <code>SourceReference</code>. Two subclasses of <code>SourceReference</code>,
<code>SourceSectionReference</code> and <code>SourcePageReference</code>, are provided to 
more clearly define the location of the material within the source. These reference objects
link data objects to their source material.

Source materials are defined by the <code>SourceMaterial</code> class, which tracks information
about a source - such as its title, author(s), and copyright information. As the <code>SourceMaterial</code>
class is geared mostly toward sourcebooks, two subclasses have been provided to handle more 
specialized sources - <code>SourcePeriodical</code> for magazine articles and <code>SourceURL</code>
for Web sites and electronic downloads.
